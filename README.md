<h2>All the code and help to make the survival boat list app and other help for my brain.</h2>
<main><p>
     This is somewhat a scrambled attempt of beginner attempting to learn code as quickly as possible.
I would like to use every resource I can find on the internet, especially open-source and free knowledge. There are many projects in my head including some around my lifestyle of a sailor. Things that are needed on a boat, like AIS and possible solutions that cost less and use less space. I have also looked into small computers to do the job efficently, like Chip or Rasberry Pi. It is difficult to know where I am going especially when there are so many ways, but perhaps this hub will help to get that know-how focused into completing the task. 

Thank you in advance :)
